# STARS
The Signal Tool for the Analysis of Relationships between Sequences (STARS) applies an unsupervised technique, called Clustering (K-means), to group DNA sequences without using traditional approaches.

How to use STARS?
    By executing the file InterfazVer1punto0.m the system will show you the main window of STARS.

Test
    A fasta file with 131 organisms (131_COXI.fasta) is provided along with a complete user manual (STARS User Manual.pdf).
